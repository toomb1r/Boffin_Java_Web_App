Hello, 

I did this project for a Boffin factory workshop. I learned how to code up a java web application using Gradle. I learned HTML formatting using .mustache files and HTTP structure. I may further this project and possibly use it to host a website for my resume.


What is Boffin factory? It is wright states former senior projects meet up spot. Now they host a whole range of events that furthers coding knowledge.
